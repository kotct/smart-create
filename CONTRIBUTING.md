Contributing to smart-create
============================

We'll be generally accepting of contributions, as long as they follow some basic guidelines.
Firstly, track our merge-pool branch or something branched from that, not master.
Secondly, commit to a feature branch.
This helps with organization and also quick identification of what a branch was used for.
Submit a pull request once you're done.
